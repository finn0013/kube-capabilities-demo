# Kubernetes
This is a demonstration of the kubernetes capabilities. It is intended to explore and provide examples for different parts of the kubernetes/docker ecosystems and how things fit together, along with variations. The goal is to provide basic visualization along with  these concepts in order to make it easer to grasp for newcomers.

This project will likely evolve into a staging place for experimenting with new concepts, such as expanding pods out to use things like flume, kafka, etc.
